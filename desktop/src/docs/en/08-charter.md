# Chapter 8: Executive Dashboard & Charter 📊

The **Charter** page (also called Executive Dashboard) is JinnLog's most powerful management view. It brings together project governance, objectives, risks, deliverables, and performance tracking in a single place.

## 📊 The Stats Row

At the top of the page, four summary cards give you an instant overview:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Completion** | Percentage of tasks completed in the project |
| **Overdue** | Number of tasks past their deadline |
| **Deliverables** | Completed deliverables out of total (e.g., "3/7") |
| **High Risks** | Number of risks rated as High or Critical |

A **status badge** appears at the top showing the overall project status:
*   🟢 **ON_TRACK**: Everything is going well.
*   🟡 **AT_RISK**: Some indicators need attention.
*   🔴 **DELAYED**: The project is behind schedule.
*   ⚫ **BLOCKED**: Critical blockers preventing progress.

## 📋 Project Charter

The Charter is the foundational document of your project. It defines:

### Charter Info Card
*   **Sponsor**: Who is sponsoring/funding the project (text field).
*   **Project Manager**: Who is leading the project (text field).
*   **Objectives**: What the project aims to achieve (text area).
*   Click **"Edit"** to modify these fields, then **"Save"** to save changes.

### Charter Sections (Markdown)
Below the info card, you'll find expandable sections with rich Markdown editing:
*   **Goals / Problem Statement**: What problem does this project solve?
*   **Business Case**: Why is this project worth doing?

Each section has an **Edit/Save** toggle button. When editing, a full Markdown editor appears. When saved, the rendered content is displayed.

    *   **Unit** (e.g., "users", "percentage", "revenue").
4. Click **"Add"**.

### Tracking Progress
*   Each Key Result shows a **current value** input and a **target value**.
*   The progress bar updates automatically based on current/target ratio.
*   Colors indicate progress: 🟢 green (>=100%), 🔵 blue (>=50%), 🟡 yellow (<50%).
*   The OKR's overall progress is the average of all its Key Results.
